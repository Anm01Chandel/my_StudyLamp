# Lamp Control with Sound Sensor

This Arduino project allows you to control a lamp using a sound sensor. The lamp can be toggled between three different states based on the sound level detected by the sensor.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Sound sensor module
- Lamp (or any load you want to control)
- Motor driver module (e.g., L298N)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply (e.g., 12V DC)

## Setup

1. Connect the sound sensor to an analog pin on the Arduino board (e.g., A0).
2. Connect the lamp to the outputs of the motor driver.
3. Connect the motor driver to the Arduino board according to its datasheet.
4. Ensure proper power supply to the Arduino board and the motor driver.
5. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.

## Usage

1. When the sound sensor detects sound above a certain threshold, the lamp state will toggle.
2. The lamp can be in one of three states: 
    - State 1: Only 5V is supplied.
    - State 2: 5V and GND2 are supplied.
    - State 3: 5V, GND1, and GND2 are supplied.
3. View the sensor readings and lamp states via the serial monitor at 9600 baud rate.

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for improving this project:

- **Motor Driver Power Supply**: Implement a motor driver module to provide power supply to the lamp for better control and efficiency.
- **Brightness Control**: Integrate PWM control using the motor driver to adjust the lamp's brightness based on the sound level.
- **Remote Control**: Integrate a wireless module (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to control the lamp remotely using a smartphone or computer.
- **Power Saving Mode**: Add a feature to put the lamp into a low-power mode when not in use.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize sensor readings and control the lamp settings more intuitively.
- **Safety Features**: Incorporate safety features such as overload protection and temperature monitoring to prevent damage to the components.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allow users to customize the sound detection threshold and lamp behavior according to their preferences.
